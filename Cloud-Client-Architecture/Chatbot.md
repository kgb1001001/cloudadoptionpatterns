# Chatbot

You are building applications that will be used by a variety of users, including those who prefer to interface through platforms such as Text (SMS), or various social media chat platforms. This is related to the fact that most of your customers use a Mobile device as their primary means of accessing your application functionality, and these chat platforms are where your users spend the majority of their time.  Unfortunately, which platform predominates depends on location, culture, and a variety of other reasons that lead to a proliferation of platforms if you want to have reach across geographies, ages and other demographic factors.

**How do you both provide an optimized user experience and bring your application functionality to these customers on a variety of different social media platforms?**

In many types of applications, such as customer support, it is often hard to build a web site or application that naturally allows people to go directly to the specific piece of information that they need. Users resist navigating deep hierarchies of static pages, and FAQs become unwieldly when there are more than a few dozen entries.  Search tools like Google can alleviate this somewhat, but that depends on both the information developer and the user seeing eye-to-eye about the phrasing of keywords and other aspects of search engine optimization.  Instead, what often happens is that people look for help when they are stuck on social media sites; this could be something like Facebook or Twitter, or perhaps a more specialized site like LinkedIn.  The key here is that humans trust other humans to give them advice - often more so than they would trust the very same information if it were found on a website. 

What is needed is some way to meet these users where they are - to give them an interaction that either feels like interacting with a human, or that may be actually interacting with a human, intermediated through a program that may first organize the category of help and other prerequisites that a human needs to solve their problem efficiently. 

Therefore,

**Build a chatbot that can be plugged into different social media platforms.**

Chatbots are not a new form of technology - in a sense they can be traced back all the way to the Eliza program written by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966.  However, recent improvements in Natural Language Processing has made it easier and more efficient to build them than before. 

An important consideration in building a Chatbot is that you have to consider that it is a user interface channel into an Enterprise application much like any other user interface choice.  That means you have to plan for connecting requests from your chatbot into the back-end API's that your system presents, although due to the coversational nature of the interaction, these API's often end up being heavily mediated to strip down large amounts of data into smaller answers more uniquely suited to the nature of chat.  That means that pattenrs like [Backend for Frontend](../Microservices/Backend-For-Frontend.md) become even more important as you consider chatbots as part of an architecture.
