# Cloud Client Architecture Introduction

This set of patterns is built around developing a consistent client architecture that is compatible with a cloud-native application development style.

+ [Modern Web Architecture](Modern-Web-Architecture.md) is the root pattern of this section and describes the overall structure of a client application.
+ [Native Mobile Application](Native-Mobile-Application.md) describes one solution for a client that is increasingly common as mobile devices proliferate
+ [Chatbots](Chatbot.md) are a common and important user interface channel for specialized types of user interaction like customer suppport.
+ [Single Page Application](Single-Page-Application.md) is the most common approach to building client-side applications that fully use the power of modern browsers
+ [Micro Frontends](micro-frontends.md) are a way to avoid recommitting the mistakes of Monoliths within a client-side application.
+ [Near Cache](Near-Cache.md) is a way of making Single Page Applications perform well when combined with a Microservices Architecture.
