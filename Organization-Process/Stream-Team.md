# Stream Team

You are either building a new application with [Cloud Centric Design]() or applying [Cloud Refactoring]() in order to modernize an existing application to run on the cloud.  

**How do your organize an application team to be able to successfully build an application for the cloud using [Cloud Native DevOps]() principles that also takes into account the constraints that architectural principles like the [Microservices Architecture]() place on a team?**

**Divide the overall work up into multiple, independent (or loosely coupled) work streams, divided along domain lines.  Define one or more self-sufficient Stream Teams (one per workstream) that each are responsible for a well-defined portion of the application, and that are sized as [Two Pizza Teams](Two-Pizza-Team.md). Stream teams are responsible for building, testing, and deploying their portion of the application from end to end.**
