# Two Pizza Team

You are implementing a Cloud Native Design or implementing Cloud Refactoring.  You need to decide how big your teams can get in order to keep team productivity at its highest peak.

**How large should a team get before it becomes too unwieldly?**

There is a tension that everyone who has been in any software development team of any size has ever experienced - how big is too big and how small is too small?  There are small software projects that can be accomplished by a dedicated team of one or two people, but most software projects will require a larger team.  However, as Fred Brooks first pointed out in [The Mythical Man Month] as the size of a software development team increases, the rate at which the code can be produced actually slows down as the number of potential communications paths between people (which is reflected in the software, aka Conway's Law) increases.  

What's more, there is an abundance of social science research that shows that humans simply perform better in smaller groups, and that our ability to form trusted relationships tends to max out in the high single digits or low double digits [citation needed]().  However, software is a complex entity.  There are a lot of steps required to plan, write and test a large program.  One of the things that Agile development has shown is that handoffs create friction.  Reducing handoffs between formal teams is critical to achieving rapid releases.  So, including all of the necessary skills within a team is crucial - you can't "outsource" a critical step in the software development process and still remain Agile.

Therefore,

**Make teams self-sufficient entities that have all necessary expertise on board (development, operations, testing, business, etcetera) but keep them to a size where two pizzas are sufficient to provide lunch/dinner for the whole team.**
