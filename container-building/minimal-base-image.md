# Minimal Base Image

You are building an application for deployment into containers.  You want to be able to take advantage of the benefits of containers, such as rapid startup and small memory footprint.  However, you want to spend your time developing your application and not spending time and effort in packaging.

**How do you ensure that you reduce the total amount of work you have to do in preparing your Docker images, ensure you do not have to apply updated patches and at the same time reduce your potential attack surface?**

**Use a minimal base image.**
