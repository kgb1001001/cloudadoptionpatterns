Container Grouping
===

Context: Clound Native Devops.

I think the following three slides from KB's deck are relevant here - copy/paste job:

## Deployment: Containerization

Context: Application Development
Problem: How do you package a section of an application such that its function will be absolutely consistent across lifecycle stages and deployment targets?

Solution: Take advantage of Containerization and package your application code inside a container.

Examples: Docker, Warden Containers in Cloud Foundry, Windows Server Containers and Hyper-V Containers in Azure

## Deployment: Aggregate

Problem: When performing Cloud Tuning, how do you define a reusable architecture that defines a generic application structure independent of particular application artifacts?

Solution: Define an Aggregate of services, runtimes, and the connections between them

Examples: PureApplication Patterns, HOT Templates, Docker Compose YMLâ€™s
