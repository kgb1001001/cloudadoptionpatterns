Aggregate Descriptor
===

**How do you define a reusable architecture independent of particular application artifacts?**

**Define an Aggregate Descriptor of services, runtimes, and the connections between them.  This Aggregate Descriptor is executed by a Deployment Engine that reads the descriptor and creates the necessary containers and other aspects of the runtime system.**

Examples: HELM charts, Docker Compose YMLâ€™s, Operators
