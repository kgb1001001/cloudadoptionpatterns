Event Stream Management
===

Context: Operating cloud-native application

Problem: How to keep oversight/obtain insights in the cloud of microservice processes?

Solution: Have microservices emit logging and metrics as an event stream; centralize collection and processing.

(move away from text logs to json logs?)
