Global Locks
===

There are various circumstances where work needs to be coordinated between datacenters. For instance, [Synchronous Replication](Sync-Replication.md) in an otherwise transaction-less key/value store could result in write conflicts; another example is where a single process should work on data and the process should only be started in (potentially) a different datacenter when the original one goes down. Coordination can also mean turning an asynchronous system into a synchronous one by waiting until the replication has happened; preferably, other systems shouldn’t be writing at that time.

*Therefore,*

**Have a system to implement locking across datacenters. With these global locks, it becomes possible to coordinate systems and actions between datacenters. A transaction can be scoped by taking a lock; writes to otherwise transaction-less systems can then be serialized on the lock. A single process to do work can be elected similarly: one process holds a long-running lock, and when it fails, the lock is released and other processes then have a chance to obtain it and start performing work.**

Like synchronous replication, locking across datacenters is expensive and not transparent to the locking process. Locks can fail, they take some time to obtain as they must be coordinated with instances of the locking system running in multiple datacenters, and the name or key to lock on must be chosen carefully to balance between locking contention (lock names too coarse grained) and risk of conflicts (lock names too fine grained). It’s a tool in the distributed system designer’s toolbox, but not one that should be retrieved at the first hint that it might solve a problem.

[Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) is a distributed consensus system originally implemented by YaHoo! to coordinate their massive (for that time) networks. YaHoo! wrote the system to perform leader election, locking, and to act as a service registry. It has been around for a long time and can be considered battle-hardened, and it performs very well as a global locking service.

One way to run Zookeeper is to have 5 nodes over [Three Datacenters](../Cloud-Native-DevOps/Three-Data-Centers.md). Zookeeper does not benefit from more machines (as the leader of the cluster is the bottleneck), and in this way the outage of any datacenter will leave a quorum intact; furthermore, two machines in different datacenters can go down with no impact. This is a general pattern for data replication that is applicable to replicated systems like Cassandra and Kafka as well; contrary to datacenter outages, machine outages are common, and with a 3 node setup a single node failure would immediately put the system at risk of not being available.

Interacting with Zookeeper is quite low level and requires a lot of knowledge on how the various primitives are implemented; in essence, it is more a toolbox than an end-user application. Various users have published “recipes” for interacting with Zookeeper in library form, and their use is recommended– [Apache Curator](https://curator.apache.org/) is a leading software component in this field.
