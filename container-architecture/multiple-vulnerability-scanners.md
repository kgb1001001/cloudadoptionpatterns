# Multiple Vulnerability Scanners

You are developing a new application that is hosted in a container and you want to ensure that container images with known vulnerabilities are not deployed to your environment.

**Not all vulnerability scanners use the same vulnerability databases and some are more complete than others. How do we ensure we donâ€™t rely on a single source of vulnerability information for discovering and reporting issues?**

Vulnerability Scanners come from different vendors and open source teams and as a result, different vulnerability scanners will be updated at different rates.  Likewise, different vulnerability scanners use different databases and a specific vulnerability may not be reported in all databases.  It is also possible that any particular vulnerability scanner may fail to detect a vulnerability, either because of bugs or because a malware author can attack a vulnerability scanner itself. 

Therefore:

**Use Multiple Pipeline Vulnerability Scanners such as Clair and the IBM Vulnerability Advisor at multiple points in your pipeline.**

The best pattern in such a scenario would be to use an open-source scanner such as Clair as part of your CI/CD pipeline and use a different vulnerability scanner for your image registry.

Applying multiple vulnerability scanners to address deficiencies or blind spots in a single scanner or database is a well-known best practice in the security industry documented in [SoftwareSecured](https://www.softwaresecured.com/choosing-a-vulnerability-scanner/).  Using multiple vulnerability scanners within your Docker Build Pipeline gives you an increased level of security as there is a reduced risk of vulnerability not being found due a single scanner not being aware of the vulnerability.
