# Basic DevOps Introduction
Continuous Integration and Delivery has become the de-facto standard for most Agile and Lean processes. Many of these development processes help teams respond to unpredictability through incremental, iterative work cadences and through empirical feedback. Regular delivery of reliable working software that has the highest value to those using or benefiting from the software is becoming more important for the success of many companies. Actually, the first principle behind the Agile manifesto is: "our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.” That has led to the acceptance of DevOps, which advocates automation and monitoring at all steps of software construction, from integration, testing, releasing to deployment.

However, blindly following Agile practices isn’t sufficient to help sustain delivering quality software at a good pace with confidence. Quite often system qualities, such as reliability, scalability, or performance, are overlooked or simplified until late in the development process, thus causing time delays due to extensive refactoring and rework of the software design required to correct quality flaws. There are other practices (patterns) that can help with this, such as reflection time, finding ways to improve, and building quality into the process and product from the start [YWA, YW, YWW14, YWW15, YWW16a, YWW16b]. 
The goal is to be able to safely and quickly release our software in a sustainable way. Continuous Delivery and DevOps focus on both automation and team practices that can help with delivering more quickly and reliably. Automation and a good pipeline that includes quality steps has proven invaluable for raising confidence in the release. This paper will focus on the “Quality Delivery Pipeline” as a practice that can help sustain delivering with confidence by addressing important qualities in the pipeline.
