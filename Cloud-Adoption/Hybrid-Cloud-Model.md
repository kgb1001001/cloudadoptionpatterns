# Hybrid Cloud Model

One of the earliest decisions many teams make (although perhaps too early) when moving to the cloud is deciding what destination that they should move to. A common misconception is that moving to the cloud means moving workloads to a specific *public* cloud.  The problem is that this is too simplistic to reflect the real world - you can have cloud computing without necessarily moving to a public cloud, and what's more, systems can actually cross multiple clouds, both public and private.

**How do you balance the needs of security, productivity, cost-effectiveness and skills development when moving to a cloud computing approach?**

In order to understand why the simplistic model of "cloud==one public cloud" is insufficient, let's go all the way back to the 2011 National Institutes of Standards (NIST) definition of Cloud Computing.  NIST defined cloud computing as "a pay-per-use model for enabling available, convenient and on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction."  Now let's break that apart.  Pay-per-use does NOT necessarily mean you are paying another company - pay-per-use is a statement of the accounting on the user side.  Many large IT shops have cost accounting systems that allow them to bill resources by the use, per user.  What's more the self-provisioning statement also does not necessarily imply that the computing resources must be held by a separate company.  Again, many large IT organizations also pool resources, and provide self-provisioning capabilities within their IT infrastructures. 

In short, cloud computing can embrace multiple models, both on-premise and off-premise.  While there are obviously many cases in which a public cloud provider is exactly the right choice for many projects, there are perhaps just as many in which it is the wrong choice for a particular workload. There are several factors which weigh on this:

Security and Data Residency:  While public cloud security 
Productivity and Skills:
Cost-Effectiveness:

Therefore,

**Choose a Hybrid Cloud model that allows project teams to choose the right location, on-premise or off-premise, private or public, that fits their needs for security, data protection, cost-effectiveness, and skills**
